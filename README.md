# Dual RP2040 board

This is a board with 2 rp2040s sharing an 8bit bus. I designed it to experiment with interchip communication. It calso has pinouts for some peripherals.
You can find schematics in pcb_files and the Gerbers in production_files.

I wouldn't suggest sending it off for production yet, there are still some checks and verificatiosn I need to do, but this is just the current status of the work.
